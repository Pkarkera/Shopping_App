# Shopping App using PHP and Symfony

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with Car Rental App, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

### 1. Symfony installer:

In order to use the Symfony installer, we got to make sure that we create a Binary. Therefore, we need to install the following depending on your OS from:

`https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html`


If you’re not sure if you got that installed, you can run the following command to see if your local machine meets the requirements.

`symfony check:requirements`

If you have your environment setup correctly, you will be hit with the following message:

`[OK]
Your system is ready to run Symfony projects`

Symfony’s CLI comes with a web server that is very easy to use. In order to use it, you need to run the following command inside the project directory:

`symfony server:start `

This will return back a message which says that your web server is indeed listening, and it can be accessed through your localhost.

### 2. Visual Studio Code:

Download Visual Studio Code from the following link:

`https://code.visualstudio.com/download`

## About the Project:

1. In this project I have created a simple Shopping App using PHP.

2. I have created Register Page and Login Page that would create the user and help login into the app.

3. I have also created a logout page that would log out the person logged in.
